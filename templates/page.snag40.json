Color-coded food preparation equipment and utensils ensure food ingredients are at minimized risk of cross-contamination. ICON Meals is audited regularly by local, state and national agencies to ensure compliance. We pride ourselves in attaining the highest audit scores. Our Department of Health Inspection results are available upon request. To ensure all meals remain at the optimum temperature during transport and upon delivery, we designed our own thermally-insulated cooler bag, which is packed with dry ice and sealed shut to ensure no tampering and that client’s meals arrive safely.</p>",
