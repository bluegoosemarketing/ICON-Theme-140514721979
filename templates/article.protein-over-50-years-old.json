It’s your biology.</p><p>As busy professionals and parents, we often blame our schedule for our energy levels. But the real culprit is a phenomenon known as <strong>Anabolic Resistance</strong>. Simply put: as you age, your muscles stop listening to the \"grow and repair\" signals from food—unless that signal is loud enough.</p>",
